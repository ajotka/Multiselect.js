# Multiselect.js
Multiselect.js is a simple library which can change your multiple select into a dropdown with checkboxes. It is fully compatible with datatables.js library. Main js was written in ES6 with use of npm gulp, which I recommend.

## Install
1. Download multiselect.js to your js assets
2. Add class and placeholder to your multiselect
3. Enjoy

## Requirements
- class: *js-multi-select*
- placeholder: *placeholder="Text"* (even it is empty)

## Sample HTML
```
<select name="filter-interests"
        id="filter-interests"
        class="js-multi-select" placeholder="Interests">
    <option value="art">Art</option>
    <option value="fashion">Fashion</option>
    <option value="sport">Sport</option>
    <option value="music">Music</option>
</select>
```
